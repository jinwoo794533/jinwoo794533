I'm currently attending Daedeok SW Meister High School and will graduate soon. <br>
I have experience in creating and operating web service servers for my school. Additionally, I was involved in [info-dsm](https://github.com/info-dsm) club as the president, and I won prizes in the Daejeon Regional Skills Competition

I have an interest in the following areas, but not limited to:
